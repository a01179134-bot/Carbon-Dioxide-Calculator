# Carbon-Dioxide-Calculator
Our project is a carbon dioxide calculator. This means that, based on a few questions the code asks you and considering your answers, it will calculate whether you have a low, medium, or high carbon footprint, and therefore, whether you need to reduce it for the sake of the environment.

*Add to the same folder the country.csv file for the code to work properly.*

The code currently includes all the features; however, in the next phase, we would like to incorporate elements that enhance the design and make the coding look more stylistically complex and advanced.
What we want to achieve and the impact of our code is that when people see the great damage they are causing to the planet, they will become more aware of what they are doing and try to reduce their carbon footprint, thus helping to make a difference and reduce environmental pollution.
