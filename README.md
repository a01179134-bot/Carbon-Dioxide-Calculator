# Carbon-Dioxide-Calculator
Our project is a carbon dioxide calculator. This means that, based on a few questions the code asks you and considering your answers, it will calculate whether you have a low, medium, or high carbon footprint, therefore, whether you need to reduce it for the sake of the environment.

*import libraries:* 
- import difflib
- import pandas as pd


*Add to the same folder the country.csv file for the code to work properly.* 

What we aim to achieve and the impact of our code is that when people see the great damage they are causing to the planet, they will become more aware of their actions and try to reduce their carbon footprint. Thus, helping to make a difference and reduce environmental pollution.
We encountered numerous technical difficulties while creating our carbon footprint calculator, which ultimately led to an improved final product. One of the main obstacles was making sure the calculations were precise and flexible enough to deal with multiple user inputs, which meant continuously checking data and improving formulas. To maintain the program's effectiveness and accessibility, we also had to incorporate loops, conditional expressions, and external libraries. Overcoming these obstacles increased our general programming and problem-solving skills while also improving the calculator's functionality.
