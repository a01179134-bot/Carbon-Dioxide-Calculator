# Carbon-Dioxide-Calculator
Our project is a carbon dioxide calculator. This means that, based on a few questions the code asks you, taking into account your answers, it will calculate whether you have a low, medium, or low carbon footprint, and therefore, whether you need to reduce it for the sake of the environment.
